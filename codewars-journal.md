### Challenge 1: Remove String Spaces (8kyu)

- **Link:** https://www.codewars.com/kata/57eae20f5500ad98e50002c5
- **Description:** Write a function that removes all spaces from a string.
- **My Solution:**
  ```js
  function noSpace(x) {
    return x.replace(/\s/g, '');
  }

- What I Learned:
This challenge helped reinforce using regular expressions in JavaScript. The \s matches whitespace, and the g flag removes all occurrences. I originally considered using a loop or split/join, but .replace() with regex was simpler and more efficient.

- Other Notes:
It's great to see how concise string manipulation can be using built-in methods.

### Challenge 2: Sum of Positive (8kyu)

- **Link:** https://www.codewars.com/kata/5715eaedb436cf5606000381
- **Description:**  
  Given an array of numbers, return the sum of all positive numbers. If no positive numbers exist, return 0.

- **My Solution:**
  ```js
  function positiveSum(arr) {
    return arr.filter(n => n > 0).reduce((sum, n) => sum + n, 0);
  }

- What I Learned:
This challenge helped me practice array methods. I used .filter() to extract positive numbers and .reduce() to calculate the sum. It reminded me that chaining methods can keep code concise and readable.

- Other Notes:
I originally considered looping manually, but using built-in methods made the solution shorter and more elegant.

### Challenge 3: Count by X (8kyu)

- **Link:** https://www.codewars.com/kata/5513795bd3fafb56c200049e
- **Description:**  
  Create a function that returns a sequence of `n` multiples of `x`.

- **My Solution:**
  ```js
  function countBy(x, n) {
    const result = [];
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      result.push(x * i);
    }
    return result;
  }

- What I Learned:
This challenge was a solid review of for loops and array manipulation. I practiced multiplying inside a loop and storing results in a growing array.

- Other Notes:
The challenge was very readable and helped reinforce the pattern of iterating from 1 to n with i <= n.

### Challenge 4: Return Negative (8kyu)

- **Link:** https://www.codewars.com/kata/55685cd7ad70877c23000102
- **Description:**  
  Return the negative version of a number. If it's already negative or 0, return it unchanged.

- **My Solution:**
  ```js
  function makeNegative(num) {
    return num > 0 ? -num : num;
  }

- What I Learned:
I practiced using the ternary operator for simple conditional logic. The challenge also reinforced thinking about edge cases like 0 and already-negative numbers.

- Other Notes:
Short and clean â€” a nice warm-up for thinking about number handling and logic.
